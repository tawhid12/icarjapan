                        When you take part in the bidding process, you will need to pay a security deposit. The deposited amount is absolutely refundable if there is any unsuccessful bidding happens. Moreover If you want to bid another car with that amount, you can do it without any farther charge. What will happen to the security deposit with the successful bidding? We do adjust the security deposit with the invoice amount of the vehicle you buy from the auction.
